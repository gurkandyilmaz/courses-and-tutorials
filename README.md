# mit6-0001/6-0002
This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets of the courses [**Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) and 
[**Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/) from MIT.

Right now, only the solutions for the 6-0001 course are available. However, i will also upload the solutions for the course 6-0002 as soon as it is completed.
