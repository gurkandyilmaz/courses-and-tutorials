**C/C++ Exercises**

This repository contains various exercises that i have completed throughtout my learning of C/C++ languages.
Currently, i am following the book **C How to Program with an introduction to C++** by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel.
The exercises will be taken from the book and will be group by chapters.

I have used "gcc" and "clangd-11" on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS.
