**A simple flask app that serves a cnn network trained on MNIST dataset.
The app can be used via its APIs or from the UI.**

- Creating a virtual environment is optional but recommended. Use either pip or conda:
```
HandsOnDLforWeb $: conda create --name any_name_for_environment --file=conda_requirements.txt 
```
- Run the app by typing the following command in the terminal:

```python
HandsOnDLforWeb $: python flask_api.py
```
- Go to the localhost in your browser:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

An index page will be displayed and you can upload your mnist (8x8) image for prediction.
